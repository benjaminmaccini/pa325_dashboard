Se tomó altura y rendimiento del cultivo en cada sitio, este último se transformó a rendimiento relativo (RR), con esto se corrió una regresión lineal simple, según la apariencia que manifesto y la opinion de algunos autores, resultando la ecuación: Y=130.12 - 13.868(X), donde X es conductividad eléctica en dS/m, Y es rendimiento relativo en porciento con r2 de 0.804, existiendo signisicancia al 95 porciento de probabilidad en el análisis de varianza de la regresión, para cada unidad de conductividad eléctrica (dS/m); el RR del sorgo disminuyó en 13.86 porciento en el rango estudiado (3.29 a 9.80 dS/m). El parámetro que tuvo el mas alto coeficiente de determinación (r2=0.97) fue  el peso del grano por panoja para cada nivel de salinidad, esto indicó que la salinidad tiene gran efecto sobre el tamaño de la panoja en sorgo, se efectuaron una serie de correlaciones entre los iones siendo el bicarbonato el unico que presento efecto antagónico sobre los demás."},

	abstract = {Extreme value analysis of drought indices was used to assess the likelihood of drought over the UK during the 20th century and potential future changes due to increased atmospheric greenhouse gasses. Precipitation indices were derived using 3, 6, 12 and 18 month accumulations, normalised by the 1961–1990 mean and standardized by the corresponding standard deviation. A soil moisture index, similarly standardized, was calculated from monthly soil moisture data. Output from an 11-member perturbed physics ensemble of the Hadley Centre regional climate model (HadRM3), forced at the boundaries by equivalent versions of the Hadley Centre global climate model (HadCM3), was evaluated against available observational-based reference data. Soil moisture reference data were derived from a distributed land surface scheme driven by meteorological reanalysis. Whilst the model ensemble underestimates the variability of the precipitation climatology in the reference data, it accurately replicates the extreme characteristics of dry months for the majority of the ensemble members. Differences in land surface characteristics and the representation of sub-grid scale heterogeneity means that there are signiﬁcant differences in the representation of soil moisture between model and reference data. However, when HadRM3 is forced at the boundaries by ERA-40 reanalysis data the extreme characteristics of low soil moisture are replicated by the model ensemble indicating that using the regional climate model ensemble to downscale from the coarse resolution of HadCM3 is appropriate. Projections of drought for the 21st century were estimated by applying non-stationary extreme value theory to these monthly drought indices. All drought indices show an overall increase in drought in the future. However, the spread of values is considerable ranging from little change or a slight decrease to a signiﬁcant increase depending on ensemble member and, to a smaller extent, location. The impact of these projections are put in the context of the notorious UK drought of the summer of 1976.

The Lower Rio Grande Water Quality Initiative Decision Support System (LRGWQIDSS) is the result of a multidisciplinary effort to integrate the results of qualitative social science research and traditional and novel engineering and geographic information systems (GIS) methods associated with the modeling, analysis, and visualization of watershed, water quality and natural resources data. The LRGWQIDSS incorporates information currently used by urban planning and natural resource management organizations working along the Texas-Mexico border area and provides a means to analyze and display the information in a way that is useful to institutional and noninstitutional actors involved in transboundary water quality planning efforts. The analysis of the institutional arrangements currently in place to protect water quality in the Lower Rio Grande/Río Bravo played an important role in the design and development of the LRGWQIDSS and its successful application. The tool’s development represents a case study in the importance of the role of institutional analysis in the successful development of decision support systems for transboundary water quality management.},

	abstract = {La salinidad en la zona norte de México se ha acrecentado de manera significativa en las últimas décadas, amenazando la productividad agrícola de varias cuencas, entre ellas la del río Conchos. Una investigación más completa a este respecto es necesaria para determinar si este incremento es un fenómeno temporal, periódico o permanente. En este estudio, se determinaron las variaciones de salinidad, tanto temporales, como a lo largo del bajo río Conchos, usando para ello datos reportados durante los últimos 20 años por agencias gubernamentales y varios investigadores. Fuentes de origen de esta salinidad incluyen procesos como la evaporación y la disolución de material geológico, a los que se añade salinidad proveniente de drenes de irrigación y la causada por procesos menos evidentes, como la infiltración de agua subterránea salina. La salinidad a lo largo del bajo río Conchos aumenta gradualmente con incrementos súbitos en algunos puntos. Uno de éstos se debe a la descarga de un dren de irrigación a la altura de Delicias, donde el contenido de sodio aumenta en 40\% y el calcio en 10\%. En 1997, la salinidad a lo largo del bajo río Conchos, expresada en términos de conductividad eléctrica, aumentó de 0.26 dS m-1 a la altura de Camargo a 2.03 dS m-1 después de recibir descargas de irrigación cerca a Delicias, para luego disminuir a 1.89 dS m-1 en Cuchillo Parado y a 1.86 dS m-1 a su desembocadura. La variación de la salinidad del bajo río Conchos con respecto al tiempo fluctúa de manera considerable y presenta una tendencia de aumento.},

It is recommended that the people of the valley urge and facilitate an early adjudication of rights. Certainty in water rights will encourage investments in the resource and help to implement needed facilities. Improvements in irrigation and drainage could be achieved by reorganizing the special districts. A master district for the three-county area may be a logical alternative to the many districts that now exist. Rehabilitation of irrigation systems, including installation of water meters, will contribute to the management of water supplies},

	abstract = {The Lower Rio Grande Valley Transboundary Air Pollution Project (TAPP) was a US-Mexico Border XXI Program project to assess transboundary air pollution in and near Brownsville, Texas. The study used a three-site air monitoring network very close to the border to capture the direct impact of local sources and transboundary transport. Ambient data included particulate mass and elemental composition, VOCs, PAHs, pesticides, and meteorology. Also, near real-time, PM\{sub 2.5\} mass measurements captured potential pollutant plume events occurring over 1-h periods. Data collected were compared to screening levels and other monitoring data to assess general air pollution impacts on nearby border communities. Wind sector analyses, chemical tracer analyses, principal component analyses, and other techniques were used to assess the extent of transboundary transport of air pollutants and identify possible transboundary air pollution sources. Overall, ambient levels were comparable to or lower than other urban and rural areas in Texas and elsewhere. Movement of air pollution across the border did not appear to cause noticeable deterioration of air quality on the US side of the Lower Rio Grande Valley. Dominant southeasterly winds from the Gulf of Mexico were largely responsible for the clean air conditions in the Brownsville airshed. Few observations of pollutants exceeded effects screening levels, almost all being VOCs; these appeared to be due to local events and immediate influences, not regional phenomena or persistent transboundary plumes},

The border region depends heavily on the Rio Grande River both for water for sustenance and industrial use, as well as for wastewater disposal. The Texas Water Development Board, acting under the Texas Legislature, directed the development of regional water plans that were published early in 2001. Three regions were identified in the plans to include the Texas–Mexico border, namely, the Far West region, the Plateau region, and the Rio Grande region. Although these plans provide the basis for further work on managing water resources in the region, they do not address the adequacy of water quality and quality assurance in the region. Because water from the Rio Grande is being reused at numerous locations along the border, water-quality investigations must be given a high priority now.},

	abstract = {In probability theory and statistics, the Gumbel distribution (also known as the type-I generalized extreme value distribution) is used to model the distribution of the maximum (or the minimum) of a number of samples of various distributions.
This distribution might be used to represent the distribution of the maximum level of a river in a particular year if there was a list of maximum values for the past ten years. It is useful in predicting the chance that an extreme earthquake, flood or other natural disaster will occur. The potential applicability of the Gumbel distribution to represent the distribution of maxima relates to extreme value theory, which indicates that it is likely to be useful if the distribution of the underlying sample data is of the normal or exponential type.
The Gumbel distribution is a particular case of the generalized extreme value distribution (also known as the Fisher–Tippett distribution). It is also known as the log-Weibull distribution and the double exponential distribution (a term that is alternatively sometimes used to refer to the Laplace distribution). It is related to the Gompertz distribution: when its density is first reflected about the origin and then restricted to the positive half line, a Gompertz function is obtained.
In the latent variable formulation of the multinomial logit model — common in discrete choice theory — the errors of the latent variables follow a Gumbel distribution. This is useful because the difference of two Gumbel-distributed random variables has a logistic distribution.
The Gumbel distribution is named after Emil Julius Gumbel (1891–1966), based on his original papers describing the distribution.},
